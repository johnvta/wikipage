        <h1>Drug Overdose in Washington State |</h1>
        <img src="img/rainer.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>Drug overdose has emerged as a serious public health concern in the United States. In the past couple decades, more than 932,000 people have died due to drug overdose. Each year, the overdose deaths keep surpassing the total number that occurred the previous year. The recent surge in overdose deaths is driven by fentanyl which is involved in more than 50% of confirmed cases. Drug use and mortality continue to increase nationally and across Washington State. This website focuses on the spatial distribution of fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses, and the availability of healthcare facilities at the county level in Washington State during the year 2021. To help spread awareness on drug overdose, this website will present the patterns and effects of drug overdose. The use of geospatial data will help find the geographic disparities and underlying factors that contribute to this crisis. To provide insights into the patterns and effects occurring, three thematic maps are provided that examines the distribution of drug overdose fatalities, non-fatal hospitalizations, and the availability of healthcare resources across the state.</p>
